# Empathy Maps in UX/UI Design

## Overview
Empathy maps are visual tools used in UX/UI design to better understand and empathize with the user's emotions, thoughts, behaviors, and needs at a specific point in their journey. Typically, an empathy map is divided into four quadrants that explore what the user says, thinks, does, and feels. By capturing these aspects, designers can gain deeper insights into the user's perspective, fostering empathy and guiding design decisions that better address user needs.

## Purpose of Empathy Maps
The purpose of empathy maps is to bridge the gap between user research and design by highlighting the user's internal experience. They help teams focus on the user's feelings and thoughts rather than just their actions. This can lead to more user-centered designs, ensuring that the final product truly resonates with and meets the needs of the user.

## When to Use Empathy Maps
Empathy maps are typically used during the Define stage of the design process, after initial user research has been conducted. They are useful for synthesizing research findings and clarifying user personas. Empathy maps can also be revisited during the Ideate and Prototype stages to ensure that design solutions remain aligned with the user's emotional and cognitive state throughout their journey.

### Difference Between Journey Maps and Empathy Maps
Journey maps and empathy maps are two distinct yet related tools in UX/UI design:

- **Empathy Map**: This tool focuses on understanding the user's emotions, thoughts, behaviors, and needs at a specific point in their journey. It usually consists of four quadrants: what the user says, thinks, does, and feels. The Empathy Map helps designers gain deeper insights into the user's perspective, fostering empathy and guiding design decisions.

- **Journey Map**: This tool visualizes the user's experience over time as they interact with a product or service. It maps out the different stages a user goes through, highlighting their actions, emotions, and touchpoints. The Journey Map helps designers understand the overall user experience, identify pain points, and uncover opportunities for improvement.

## Example Empathy Maps
Below is an example of an empathy map that corresponds with the Photo Booth Example from the [User Persona repository](https://github.com/WatchKataThrive/User-Personas). This example demonstrates how to capture and visualize a user's internal experience during a specific moment in their journey.
